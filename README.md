# belly-button-challenge


# Overview
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ , which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
- Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
- Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Use otu_ids for the x values.
- Use sample_values for the y values.
- Use sample_values for the marker size.
- Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
- Use otu_labels for the text values.

Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
- Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
